# CSE-340---Project-2
This project requires to write a C or C++ program that reads a description of a context free
grammar, then, depending on the command line argument passed to the program, performs one of
the following tasks: 1) for each terminal and non-terminal in the grammar determine the number
of grammar rules in which the symbol appears, 2) determine useless symbols in the grammar and
remove them, 3) calculate FIRST sets, 4) calculate FOLLOW sets and 5) determine if the grammar
has a predictive parser.
